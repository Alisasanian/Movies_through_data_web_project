      Exploring movies through data
    </h1>
  </body>

  <h2>
    <p id="aboutp1">
      Film advice was started as an attempt to bring better movie
      recommendations to people that are looking for them. The idea of
      recommending someone with a piece of entertainment they would like to
      watch, has long been an attractive topic of exploration due to its capital
      and social importance in this era. But has often been pursuid using the
      data collected from viewers, rather than providing them with data to
      facilitate the decision making process.
    </p>
    &nbsp;

    <p>
      According to The Wrap, a new study by Reelgood and Learndipity Data
      Insights found Netflix users spend on average 18 minutes on a given day
      deciding what to watch, or twice as much as cable television viewers.
      Netflix patrons also spend more days watching entertainment per week, but
      watch fewer programs per day as cable.
    </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      I believe the idea that we have genres to pick from and categories to
      choose from have become redundant to us and we do not relate to them
      anymore. The line between classical categorization of media such as movies
      vs tv shows, recently released vs outdated, horror vs drama, has long
      faded and we are left wondering why what we are looking for cannot be
      found.
    </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      Film advice uses data visualization to offer the viewer a new set of
      categories they could explore on their path to find their perfect piece of
      media they would like to interact with. When faced with an interactive
      data visualization that highlights factors that were not previously
      accessible on other streaming services, the user might find themselves
      interested in a specific actor/actress, or movies with a specific budget
      or director, which would then lead them to lookup movies from those
      directors or actors and find something they would like.
    </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      Well this might not have recommended them a movie, but has surely helped
      narrow down the field, which is often what we all really need. Somewhere
      to start looking from.
    </p>

    Profit vs. Runtime
  </h1>

  <h2>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      Well you might ask why “profit vs Runtime”, which in response I would say
      “Why not?”. This is an exploration, and the amount of interaction this
      field will absorb is the only real measure of its value and vitality as an
      included category. Looking for a certain movie with an outrageous runtime
      and a high profit might just be fun and get you to watch it again or watch
      it for the first time just to see how a director could convince millions
      of viewers to spend that much time watching their movie.

    Profit vs. Budget
  </h1>

  <h2>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      Personally, I’m a fan of big budget movies. I like dramatic CGI’s and
      massive elaborate dragons flying all over the place and I know things like
      that cost a lot of money. So I have always thought about a category that
      would just allow me to look for movies with large budgets to either
      impress me or tell me of a technique in filmmaking that costs a lot to
      execute. I have always thought this would be fun, and I hope you find it
      the same.

    Popularity vs Runtime

  <h2>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      I’m not sure if this has happened to you or not, but some nights while
      trying to find a movie to watch, I come across movies that are 2 hours and
      45 minutes and although they seem promising, I know that I don’t intend to
      stay up for another 3 hours, and for that, I continue on the search for
      something that feels the same way, but is not as long. Well, if this has
      happened to you too, feel free to check the list below and find a movie
      you would like to watch that isn’t too long or too short.
    </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      It is also important to mention that movies between 90 and 120 minutes
      have been recorded as more popular due to the frequency of higher
      popularity in that range. So if you are looking for a higher chance at
      finding something you like, feel free to focus more on the 90 min to 120
      min range.

      I myself am not a big fan of actors or actresses themselves and think that
      they are much more defined by the scope of the work they are a part of,
      but I know some of you might find it interesting to explore a bit more
      about some all time favorite actors so I’m providing this in hopes that
      some of you will enjoy exploring it.

      This connectivity graph can help users locate actors/actresses that have
      had more experience working together or within similar bubbles that the
      works they have been a part of could potentially signify a consistency in
      narration or feel. We might like a certain actor for his roles as a
      villain in darker movies and if we look closely, we might find one of two
      of their co stars that tend to prefer the same style and often perform in
      pieces that match in emotions and the way they make the audience feel.

      follow a consistent theme throughout their work. Here I have provided the
      ratings for some of the directors who have directed more than 5 movies and

    Some more serious remarks
  </h1>

  <h2>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
      Consumer spending on digital entertainment in the United States on digital
      distribution reached a record 30 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, up by over
      21 percent from the previous year.
    </p>

    &nbsp;
    <p>
      Similar to that, the largest media companies in the U.S. spent over 80
      Billion dollars on content in 2019 and Netflix which was ranked 4th in
      2019 is estimated to spend a massive 17 billion dollars on content in
      2021. The 8 billion dollar increase in content spending of Netflix
      signifies a remarkable attempt at trying to capture the most number of
      viewers by one of the largest media companies in the world and as such, an
      attempt by all media companies of the same scale to compete for capturing
      the same viewers.
    </p>
    &nbsp;

    <p>
      Film advice is an exploration into how we feel about the movies we like.
      Most movie recommendation algorithms rely on a large set of auctioned or
      collected data that was stored from millions of viewers to streamline a
      better recommendation set and at first, was indeed the building block of
      this project as well. But after looking into ways of developing this
      platform, I quickly came to the realization that this field could use a
      rather unconventional approach that would allow the viewers themselves to
      make an even more conscious decision about what they are going to watch.
    </p>
    &nbsp;

    <p>
      Film advice is a platform that allows the viewer to scroll and interact
      with a set of data visualizations that could potentially inspire them to
      watch a specific movie or a movie that has a certain actor or director.
      The idea that “a fun interaction can inspire people” is what film advice
      relies on to potentially introduce the audience to a movie or tv show they
      would find entertaining.
    </p>
    &nbsp;

    <p>
      At first glance, this might seem like a weak argument, but I hope that
      interacting with the visualizations could drastically change that opinion
      and allow you to get excited and look forward to finding something you
      would like to watch.
